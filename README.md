# `fvextra` - extensions and patches for `fancyvrb`


`fvextra` is a [LaTeX](https://www.latex-project.org/) package that provides
several extensions to the [`fancyvrb` package](https://www.ctan.org/pkg/fancyvrb).
It also patches some `fancyvrb` internals.

`fancyvrb` is one of the primary packages for working with verbatim text in
LaTeX.  `fvextra` builds on `fancyvrb` by adding support for automatic line
breaking and improving math mode, among other things.  Many of the improvements
are geared toward typesetting computer code; parts of `fvextra` were originally
developed as part of the [`pythontex`](https://github.com/gpoore/pythontex)
and [`minted`](https://github.com/gpoore/minted) packages.
